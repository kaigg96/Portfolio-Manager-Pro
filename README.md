# My Personal Project - Creating a stock portfolio manager
## Phase 0:
### Project overview:

The purpose of this project is to allow users to 
create their own stock portfolio containing shares 
of common stock in publicly traded companies. The 
user's portfolio will be a class containing a cash balance
as well as any shares owned by the user. Companies 
will be defined in a separate class.

This application is designed for **all** users, because
**investing should be for everyone**. This
project aims to simplify the user experience such
that even someone with no investing or stock market
experience can learn to build their own portfolio. 

This project is of interest to me because it bridges
my two primary areas of interest: technology and 
finance. I hope this can be the first step in a 
larger project that I can add to my resume, and 
demonstrate to future employers in the quantitative
finance field.
