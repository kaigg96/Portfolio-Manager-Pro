# My Personal Project - Creating a stock portfolio manager
## Phase 0:
### Project overview:

The purpose of this project is to allow users to 
create their own stock portfolio containing shares 
of common stock in publicly traded companies. The 
user's portfolio will be composed of a cash balance
as well as any shares owned by the user.

This application is designed for **all** users, because
**investing should be for everyone**. This
project aims to simplify the user experience such
that even someone with no investing or stock market
experience can learn to build their own portfolio. 

This project is of interest to me because it bridges
my two primary areas of interest: technology and 
finance. I hope this can be the first step in a 
larger project that I can add to my resume, and 
demonstrate to future employers in the quantitative
finance field.

### User stories:

  balance.

  of a listed company to my portfolio using my cash.

  the proceeds to my cash balance.

holdings, updating with any purchases/sales of shares.

  - Once a new company is listed, users will be able 
  to buy and sell shares of that company.

and information on each of the holdings as well as
the portfolio composition.
